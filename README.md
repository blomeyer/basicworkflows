basicworkflows
--------------
This project contains new basic workflows developed for FirstSpirit 5.<br/>
A workflow for release and one for delete that work in both, Java- and Webclient are provided.
The workflows take account of dependencies so that potential generation errors are minimized and the accessibility of all elements can be ensured. The new workflows provide - in contrast to the existing workflows, known from earlier FirstSpirit versions - an enhanced function range for editors in both FirstSpirit-Clients. One can extend the functionality by implementing invividual extensions and customising the code to the characteristics of the project.


FirstSpirit and these workflows are developed by the e-Spirit AG (http://www.e-spirit.com).</br> 
The head office of the e-Spirit AG is in Dortmund, Germany.</br></br>
